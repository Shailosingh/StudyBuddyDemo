Study Buddy is a focus-based productivity tool that incorporates a minigame to improve the user’s engagement with their own study plan. Its purpose is to help users who struggle with staying on task by introducing a rewards system they can become invested in. In academia in particular, bad grades are a major source of negative reinforcement. The main source of positive reinforcement is gaining skills and experience to help the student in their later career. However, these are usually not immediately noticeable or useful, so most of a student’s motivation comes from the fear of poor and failing grades on assessments. Our aim with this project is to introduce a source of positive reinforcement for users who need more of it in order to succeed in their studies.
