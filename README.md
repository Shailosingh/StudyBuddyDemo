# StudyBuddyDemo
Study Buddy is a focus-based productivity tool that incorporates a minigame to improve the 
user’s engagement with their own study plan. Its purpose is to help users who struggle with 
staying on task by introducing a rewards system they can become invested in. In academia in 
particular, bad grades are a major source of negative reinforcement. The main source of 
positive reinforcement is gaining skills and experience to help the student in their later 
career. However, these are usually not immediately noticeable or useful, so most of a student’s 
motivation comes from the fear of poor and failing grades on assessments. Our aim with this 
project is to introduce a source of positive reinforcement for users who need more of it in 
order to succeed in their studies.
